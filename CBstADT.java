 * <h1>Asg3: Binary Search Tree (BST)</h1>
 * <h2>Objectives</h2>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>develop your ability to implement a BST given its ADT</li>
 * <li>improve your ability to write JUnit tests</li>
 * <li>improve your ability to write readable code according to best practices
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <h2>Introduction</h2>
 * <p>
 * The CBstADT defines the API for a Bst of Characters, where only letters and
 * numerals are used. Note that a newly created CBstADT is EMPTY.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Review your notes and chapter 7 of the ODSA book for information on and
 * example code for a BST.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Your task is to implement this ADT, develop a JUnit test class, and document
 * both using Javadoc.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Instructions</h2>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Study the example code in the textbook.</li>
 * <li>Your implementation should store Character references NOT Object nor
 * Comparable references.</li>
 * <li>Your implementation should NOT use generics.</li>
 * <li>Write the Javadoc for the JUnit class.</li>
 * <li>Write the Javadoc for your implementation class. Note: you must use the
 * eclipse commands to create this class from this ADT. Do not change the
 * generated comments for the methods. Only modify the class javadoc, and write
 * javadoc for any non-public methods and fields you add.</li>
 * <li>Write the JUnit tests for the ADT described by this API.</li>
 * <li>Implement, using a Binary Tree, the ADT described by this API.</li>
 * <li>You may NOT use any pre-existing classes such as Node etc.</li>
 * <li>Submit your files to Web-CAT using the eclipse menu "Project->Submit
 * Assignment..."</li>
 * <li>To see my comments after I've graded your work, or to see your results at
 * any time, login to http://web-cat.cs.vt.edu</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <h2>Basic Tips</h2>
 * <p>
 * Write a protected method that creates a simple CBst by using the Node
 * constructors. You can then use this method to test your JUnit tests for
 * preorder. Once your preorder tests are validated, implement the preorder
 * method and test it. Once the preorder method has been validated, develop your
 * insert tests (you will need the preorder method here), then implement the
 * insert method and test it. Once these two are validated, continue with the
 * rest of the tests and methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Use the development process described in class and the slides. For example,
 * develop tests for a method, implement the method, run the tests. Do this
 * until the method passes the tests. Go on to the next method.
 * </p>
 * </p>
 * <h2>NOTES</h2>
 * <p>
 * <li>Any submission that is not a pointer-based implementation will receive NO
 * CREDIT.</li>
 * <li>Any submission that that uses pre-existing classes like Node will receive
 * NO CREDIT.</li>
 * <li>You may submit as many times as you like until the deadline.</li>
 * <li>The grade of your latest submission will be the one recorded.</li>
 * <li><b>Disregard the Web-CAT correctness grade. I will compute it
 * differently.</b></li>
 * </ul>
